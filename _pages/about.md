I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in [Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://engineering.wisc.edu/departments/industrial-systems-engineering/) at the [University of Wisconsin–Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), advised by [Prof. Kaibo Liu](https://kaibo.ie.wisc.edu/). Before joining UW–Madison, I earned a B.S. in Engineering and Finance (double major) and an M.S. in Management Science and Engineering from the South China University of Technology, advised by [Prof. Wenbin Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dnmQM1YAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

**Contact**: [ying.fu@wisc.edu](ying.fu@wisc.edu)

My research focuses on developing advanced **machine learning**, including **reinforcement learning**, and **optimization** methods to enhance prediction and decision-making across various industrial applications. Key areas include:

- Foundational Machine Learning: instance selection and high-cardinality categorical variable encoding.
- Discrete Optimization: 3D dynamic heterogeneous robotic palletization.
- Machine Learning and Optimization Integration: degradation modeling, prognostics and decision making.
- Edge Computing for Intelligent Systems: Utilizing edge computing paradigms to provide real-time analytics and quick decision capabilities.

Most recently, I have been exploring the integration of large language models (LLMs) into the decision-making pipeline, focusing on **LLM-guided dynamic task allocation** in fleet maintenance for enhanced adaptive planning and coordination in complex multi-agent systems.

# Hobbies and Interests

In my free time, I am passionate about photography and hiking. I often capture photos during my hikes, and you can view my collection [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/202095814@N04). Additionally, I enjoy playing badminton and watching movies.
