I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Industrial and Systems Engineering at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, advised by [Prof. Kaibo Liu](https://kaibo.ie.wisc.edu/). Before joining UW–Madison, I earned a B.S. in Engineering and Finance (double major) and an M.S. in Management Science and Engineering from the South China University of Technology.

My research focuses on leveraging machine learning, including reinforcement learning, and optimization techniques to advance manufacturing systems. Key areas of interest include:

- Modeling and prognostics of system degradation  
- Maintenance decision-making and optimization

**I am actively seeking a Machine Learning Engineer/Scientist internship for Summer 2025. If you're interested in my work, feel free to reach out or email me!**

Please check out my CV.
